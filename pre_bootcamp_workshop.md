Sheldon is a Front-end Developer at NTUC Link. An aspiring designer who stumbled upon the world of front-end development, he finds it a most rewarding discipline as it allows him to combine design-sensibilities with engineering-knowhow, playing on a synergy between two domains that cannot be found in any other role.

A decade and a half later, Sheldon has crafted web interfaces at UX-focused digital agencies, a mature local startup, and enterprise companies undergoing digital transformation. He tries to be good at UX/Design and Javascript at the same time, and now hopes to help guide those treading a similar path. More recently he has worked on scaling his expertise through Design Systems, and been building apps with ReactJS.
