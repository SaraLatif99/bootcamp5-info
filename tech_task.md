# Technical Task

## ü•á Introduction

The TechLadies Bootcamp #5 is a 13-week part-time accelerated learning program designed for women who wish to be professional programmers. Participants will be guided by industry experts to create products for REACH Community Services OR the Singapore Committee for UN Women.

Visit the bootcamp info page for more details.

## üõ† The Technical Task

To apply to the bootcamp, you need to complete a technical task that will help us evaluate your technical capabilities. 

We are here to help you acquire the skills you need to complete the task with 3 pre-bootcamp workshops covering: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, and ReactJS. 

We have 2 assignments that you can choose from. **Choose one to work on.**

### 1) üèû Frontend focused tech assignment

- Make a visual web app that shows us how much you know about building a website.
- We recommend using [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) to build the dynamic web app.
- This web application should have the following features:
	- An **About Me** page with a few paragraphs describing who you are, why you want to be part of the TechLadies Bootcamp, and include one image (it can be a photo of yourself or anything you like (cats are always a good option!))
	- A **Contact Me** page with info on how to reach you online (eg. LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter).
	- A navigation bar which allows you to navigate between the **About Me** and **Contact Me** Display page.

- **Stretch goal:**
    - Use the Weather Forecast public APIs here (<https://data.gov.sg/dataset/weather-forecast>) to add a weather forecast page to your website.
    - The **Weather Forecast** page should use the public API (<https://data.gov.sg/dataset/weather-forecast>), create a page to display the retrieved data. It could be a simple table element, or using map markers with map interface (e.g. <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/>)

### 2) üöå Backend focused tech assignment

- Build a JSON API service that will tell me the distance travelled on a bus route between 2 bus stops.
- Given **bus number**, **starting bus stop code**, **ending bus stop code**, and **direction**.
- Show the distance travelled between the bus stops.
- You can find the seed data here:
	- [routes.json](./tech_task/routes.json)
	- [services.json](./tech_task/services.json)
	- [stops.json](./tech_task/stops.json)

	*(downloaded from [Haoyi's Programming Blog](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/PlanningBusTripswithPythonSingaporesSmartNationAPIs.html). Originates from [LTA Datamall](https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall.html))*
- Save the data into a local database.

- **Brownie points:**
	- Calculate the current fare rate (assuming: Adult fare, Cash payment only)
	- Protect your API with authentication
	- Record the history of API calls made by users
	- Cache the results so that you don't make multiple calls to the database.

### üé© Hat tip:

To stand out from the rest, you are highly encouraged to not follow a single online tutorial to the T. Do read up on multiple resources to understand the concepts or google your way to finding how to accomplish what you want to code.

## üì¨ Submitting Your Entry

1. After you have finished building your personal website, you will need to share the source code with us. You should do so:

	- Through a link to a Git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com) (its free!)
	- Through a link to a Zip file on [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
	- Create a new repo and [push your commits in](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository).
